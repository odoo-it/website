Future plans :

* Add cookie categories and let the user decide to accept/decline those cookies
* Let the website designer define which cookies from which origins belong to which category
* Disable non-required cookies by default and only enable if the user has accepted
* Adapt cookie notice message accordingly
* Set cookies for acceptance of each category
